# LSGMM (Large-Scale Generative Mark Maker)

This machine provides the foundation for a human-robot interaction study that examines viewer interest with respect to process-centric and audience-modifiable abstract drawings.  A minimalistic design approach was used to highlight the aesthetic effect of the drawing and the machine’s motion as opposed to its visual presence.  Viewer interaction will manifest in slight, yet immediate and identifiable marks that stitch together a piece over the course of days or even weeks.  Witnessing the arc of a macroscopic structure appear, and the microscopic contributions from past viewers, is fundamental to the research, and the installation as a whole.

Drawing machines, and hanging pen plotters in particular, have been widely implemented by both the art and maker communities.  Harvey Moon’s work integrated satellite images to stitch together map-based abstractions in a similar exhibit.  Mechanically, we look to expand on existing designs by detailing a more scalable infrastructure.  In terms of interaction, we aim to hone the balance between viewer agency and structure.  Inspiration has been taken both from founders of the generative art movement (Manfred Mohr, Frieder Nake) and traditional contemporary abstractionist (Agnes Martin, Ellsworth Kelly, Eva Hesse, Sol Lewitt).  Subsequent works will examine both the mechanical and algorithmic sources of randomness and imperfection to repeated marks.
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
